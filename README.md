<h1>Sectors (Unity)</h1>

 ### [Video and Details](https://www.camfaulkner.dev/sectors)

<h2>Description</h2>
Sectors is a 3d First Person Shooter created in Unity, solely by myself, using only a single asset pack to create the environments and game around. This solo project was created to both develop a game in my favourite genre, as well as to improve upon some crucial skills related to bigger projects, of which this was my first. The content of this game includes persistent customisation and progression, as well as a guided tutorial and firing range, with a zone control gamemode being unlocked further on.
